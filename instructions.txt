Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and the Node app.

1) Create appropriate images for both apps (two separate images!).
HINT: Have a brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly!

docker build .

2) Launch a container for each created image, making sure, 
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.

docker run -p 8000:3000 imageid
docker run -it image id
docker ps

3) Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers.
Use these names to stop and restart both containers.

docker run --name containerName imageid
docker ps -a

4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers, 
clean up all created images.

docker rm containerid
docker rmi imageid
docker rm image prune -a

5) Re-build the images - this time with names and tags assigned to them.
docker build -t name:tag imageid

6) Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers
are removed automatically when stopped.
docker run -p 8000:3000 -d --name nodeapp --rm name:tag
